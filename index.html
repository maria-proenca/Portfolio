          <p class="text as-90 small first-line">At the end of another cycle of study, the project <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> emerges as a space of convergence — a place that carries the academically developed narratives of graduating students, their intersections, the discourse that arises from them, alongside the voices that sparked them, in an exchange that is never truly complete.</p>
          <span class="more">
            <p class="text as-90 small first-line">In parallel with the narratives created, <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> seeks to (re)vision design and the discourse emerging from its logics through a feminist lens, a process that itself seeks to generate counter-discourse and subvert narratives. The lens of the feminine can be understood as a counter-history, a transgression of dominant narratives and a reconfiguration of the canon. It is a rupture that takes us back to the project's title, which derives from <span class="eb-600 medium">Anneke Smelik's </span><span class="eb-600-it medium">And The Mirror Cracked</span> (1998), and to which we add a parenthesis that binds us to reality and denounces its volatility.</p>
            <p class="text as-90 small first-line">It is by challenging the constraints of the counter-narrative and making it broader that we make room for the alternative, for dreams and convictions that challenge the hegemonic discourse finally break the mirror — this is where <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> positions design.</p>

           <p class="text as-90 small first-line">The first edition, <span class="eb-600 medium">«The Night as A Place»</span> is dedicated to the Club, identity, music and the way in which, in the late 20th century, these nocturnal spaces served as a safe space for those who yearned to be themselves.
