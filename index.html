          <p class="text as-90 small first-line">At the end of another cycle of study, the project <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> emerges as a space of convergence — a place that carries the academically developed narratives of graduating students, their intersections, the discourse that arises from them, alongside the voices that sparked them, in an exchange that is never truly complete.</p>
          <span class="more">
            <p class="text as-90 small first-line">In parallel with the narratives created, <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> seeks to <span class="as-130">(re)vision design</span> and the discourse emerging from its logics through a <span class="as-130">feminist lens</span>, a process that itself seeks to <span class="as-130">generate counter-discourse</span> and <span class="as-130">subvert narratives.</span> The lens of the feminine can be understood as a counter-history, a transgression of dominant narratives and a reconfiguration of the canon. It is a rupture that takes us back to the project's title, which derives from <span class="eb-600-it medium">Anneke Smelik's</span> <span class="eb-600 medium">«And The Mirror Cracked»</span> (1998), and to which we add a parenthesis that binds us to reality and denounces its volatility.</p>
            <p class="text as-90 small first-line">It is by challenging the constraints of the counter-narrative and making it broader that we make room for the <span class="as-130">alternative, for dreams</span> and <span class="as-130">convictions</span> that challenge the <span class="as-130">hegemonic discourse</span> finally break the mirror—this is where <span class="eb-600-it medium">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked</span> positions design.</p>
